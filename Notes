Binary Cross Entropy vs Categorical Cross Entropy
- BINARY = 64% Accuracy Averaged
- Cant use categorical cross entropy because labels are not one hot encoded


Test RMSprop(lr=0.00005):
- The Validation Accuracy is staying the same for some reason
- Pretty good

The Validation data kept running out so I used the testing data instead. I still ran into overfitting before the trainig was done so I am also
going to implement data augmentation on the "validation data"

Currently training on image size (64,64,3) which is really small. Try training on bigger image sizes.

Smaller Batch Sizes increase training time

Test whether making the base model trainable increases training time
