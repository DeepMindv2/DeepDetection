# Data
The Pneumonia dataset was from Kaggle. The dataset contained 5,863 X-ray images. The dataset contained only 2 categories, Normal and Pneumonia. The dataset is roughly 3 GB in size. 

The X-ray images are from patients 1-5 years old. All chest x-ray images were taken Anterior and Posterior. 

The images come from a hospital in China, Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
A large class imbalance on the original dataset was noticed, in the train and test folders. Extensive data augmentation was needed to get accurate and reliable results. The images come in varying sizes. Of the 4 types of Pneumonia the dataset consisted of only Bacterial and Viral Pneumonia.

# Data Augmentation
Implented a cohort of Data Augmentation strategies. I found it best to just use all of them. Using the Keras-Tuner library I did a Random Search as well as a Bayesian Optimization to see which if not all Augmentation strategies yield the highest accuracies.
